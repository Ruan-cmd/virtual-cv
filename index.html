  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I grew up on a farm in the Kroonstad and Viljoenskroon areas, where I developed a strong sense of discipline, responsibility, and a deep appreciation for hands-on work. From an early age, I was involved in mechanical, electrical, and physical tasks, gaining valuable experience operating tractors and other farming vehicles. This upbringing instilled in me a practical understanding of systems and a solid foundation in problem-solving and work ethic.

My professional journey began at Minolta, where I successfully completed an intensive training program to qualify as a Printer Technician. This technical background, combined with my ability to remain calm and focused under pressure, makes me confident in high-paced, demanding environments.

Iâ€™m experienced in working with multidisciplinary teams and navigating complex stakeholder landscapes across all levels of an organization. I'm comfortable presenting, reporting to senior management, and working in diverse and even hazardous environments.

Outside of work, I have a passion for sport and the outdoors. I actively play squash, have a strong background in cricket, and enjoy golfing whenever I get the chance. I also love hikingâ€”whether it's a trail through the mountains or just exploring nature. Iâ€™m a firm believer in balance, and my love for pets brings a grounded and caring side to my personality. Whether it's a loyal dog or a curious cat, animals have always played an important role in my life.

In everything I do, I bring enthusiasm, dedication, and a deep commitment to continuous growthâ€”professionally and personally.
